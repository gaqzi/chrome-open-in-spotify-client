Open Spotify link in client
===========================

This is a small simple extension that tries to open any
open.spotify.com or play.spotify.com url in the Spotify desktop client
and then close the newly opened browser window.

The way the extension works is:

1. If the URL visited is open.spotify.com or play.spotify.com then
2. Don't do anything if the URL contains any of the following, else
   - `/embed/`: Embedded playlists
   - `/embed?`: Legacy embed playlist format
   - `/log/`: Requests to Spotify's analytics
3. Remove the protocol and domain part together with the first slash and
4. Replace those with `spotify:` and
5. Replace the remaining slashes (`/`) with colons (`:`) and
6. Redirect to that URL and
7. Close the tab that opened the URL if it was a newly opened tab

## 1.3
* Don't touch embedded links, so that websites that embed a playlist
  can do so without having Spotify trying to open the link automatically.
  Thanks [@shape55] for reporting the issue.
